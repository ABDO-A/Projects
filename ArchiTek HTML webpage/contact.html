Here are some frequantly asked questions:

</font>

<font size="4">

<br>
<br>
<br>

Q: What exactly do you guys do?

<br>
<br>

A: You can find out more about the services that we provide in our <a href="services.html"> Services </a> page.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Q: How do I know my statement has been accepted?

<br>
<br>

A: When sending us your statement, you are asked to provide an email as well. If we accept your statement request
we will send an answer with all of the details to the email provided to us. If we don't accept your statement, we
would still send you an answer back saying that your statement was refused.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Q: I've sent a statement to your firm, but I got no answer back, why is that?

<br>
<br>

A: There can be two reasons for this. The first one is that an error occured in sending back the answer in which 
case we would try to contact you again. The second case could be that you provided us with an email that is not
usable by you, if this is the case, you can contact us through our phone number and we will try our best to help
you out.

<br>
<br>
<br>

Q: How long does it usually take you guys to answer back email questions or statements? <div id="TimePeriod"> 

<br>
<br>

A: Our goal is to answer back to your questions within 48 hours (If not, maybe a little over). As for statements,
it depends on the size of the project and the materials required. Since we're only in charge of designing buildings,
the time may vary as we take a lot of factors into consideration about whether or not we're willing to design your 
project.
