<br>
<br>

<ol>

<li> After we accept a request, we respond to the email with detail on how you can pay the fees, you'll also have to sign a contract to insure you that we will get your work done and that you will pay us </li>

<li> After the client pays, we then begin to plan the project excution </li>

<li> During the designing phase, we keep contact with the client through email and phone if necessary </li>


<li> We are only in charge of designing buildings, however, we still plan the excution and save our clients the pain of the construction by outsourcing the project for construction. The construction company will take the project on from there </li>
