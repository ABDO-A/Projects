# Projects
In this repository are projects based on past labs and current on going personal projects. Each project has a description of its contents. 
If the project is in progress and not finished yet, it has the next steps written in the description.

Projects under progress:
1. Simulating an 8-bit CPU on a DE-10 Lite FPGA board.
   > In this project I am going to use my knowledge gained from my computer organization course with Verilog and C to learn FPGA programming and simulate 
     a simple 8-bit CPU on the DE-10 Lite. The tasks that I will tackle include building the smaller components (full adder, ALU, multiplexor etc.) and 
     connecting them to build the full CPU.
     
2. Building a simple shell using C.
   > In this project I am going to use my Operating system knowledge as well as my C and UNIX skills to build a simple shell and test its capabilities 
     using simple UNIX shell commands
   
3. Building a simple data base in JAVA
   > In this project I am going sharpen my data structures skills in JAVA by building a simple data base system that can efficiently store and maniuplate data.
     Currently the type of data that this system will store will most likely be rewards members for an example retail store.
