# Projects
In this repository are projects based on past labs and current on-going personal projects. Each project has a description of its contents. 
If the project is in progress and not finished yet, it has the next steps written in the description.

Projects under progress:
1. Simulating an 8-bit CPU on a DE-10 Lite FPGA board.
   > In this project I am going to use my knowledge gained from my computer organization course with Verilog and C to learn FPGA programming and simulate 
     a simple 8-bit CPU on the DE-10 Lite. The tasks that I will tackle include building the smaller components (full adder, ALU, multiplexor etc.) and 
     connecting them to build the full CPU.
